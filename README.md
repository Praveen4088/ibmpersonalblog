# ibmpersonalblog

In this repository, I have uploaded phase 1 to phase 5 documentations and code for personal blog.
To build a personal blog website,I have used HTML and CSS for front end development and host it by using ibm static web app.For more details, refer documentations.

I have created 4 HTML files where one is for home page and remaining three files for post pages.
In coding part, I have created 2 CSS files , one is for home page designs and another one is for posts.
In images file, I have attached all the images which I have used in our website.

Once the development part is done,by using ibm cloud static web app I have deployed my website.


Thank you
